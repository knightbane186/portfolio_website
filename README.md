Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Run the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
Start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.
The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
