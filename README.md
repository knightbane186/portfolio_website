Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.
The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
